# Chat-App

A simple real-time chat web application made using ReactJS and Socket.io

## Major concepts applied ##
* **React Hooks** - used several react hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext and also created custom hook to use Local Storage.
* **React Contexts** - used custom react contexts contacts details, conversation details and required information for the socket.io library.
* **Socket.io** - used socket.io to create a real-time server to connect several clients allowing bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.
